# Ano Books

>Create, edit and delete books with everybody! What could go wrong!

[Demo Site](https://ano-books.herokuapp.com/)

A full stack app that lets anyone create, edit and delete books. The concept is a bit weird, but a cool exercise for me.

## The stack

- React as frontend
- Express as backend
- Postgresql as database

## Build

Server:

- `npm install`
- `node index.js`

Frontend

- `cd frontend`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

Database init commands are in `database.sql`
